## Architecture

Sails.js application built ontop of node with express middleware.

### Node.js

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

#### New to Node? No problem.

In order to install Sails starter template, you’ll first need to install Node.js. Node is supported on most major operating systems, including MacOSX, Windows, and many flavors of Linux. Their website has pre-built installers for plenty of platforms, so you can just hop on over to the [downloads section of nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and choose the one that’ll work for you.


### Sails.js

Build practical, production-ready Node.js apps in a matter of weeks, not months.
Sails is the most popular MVC framework for Node.js, designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.
